### First Problem: Date and Leap Year

The task consists of writing and testing a method that, given an object of type date, returns whether it belongs to a leap year. If negative numbers or letters are passed, an exception indicating this situation must be thrown. 

Consider the possibility of performing these checks at the constructor level but use methods that ensure encapsulation. Furthermore, complete what is necessary to include the following aspects:

* **User Interface:** The user interface will be command-line based. Develop a component with classes and specific methods to read integers, doubles, strings, and dates from the keyboard, and to print strings and numbers to the screen.
* **Exception Handling:** Use exceptions at those points in the program where it is necessary to control the program flow.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Do not couple domain classes with the user interface (e.g., do not generate screen output in domain logic classes).
